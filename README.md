#noteate restances:
+ set the number of unique restistances
+  add the number of ohm(can be frational)
+  restances can be use multiple times in calculus
#calcul:
+  R + number notates a resitrtestance sett earlyer
+  + resistances in series
+  / resistances in paralel
+  can use () to make a bigger calculus
